Added git-mark.sh: Add marks to branch names for organization.

Allows marking branches with prefixes for workflow organization.

Example:
- Current branch: main
- git mark under-review -> renames to under-review/main
- Idempotent: calling again doesn't duplicate the mark

Uses sed to strip existing mark and prepends the new one.
