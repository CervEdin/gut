Added inline comments to clarify git-mark.sh argument parsing logic.

The argument parsing handles three scenarios:
1. '-mark' syntax: Remove mark (add=false), assumes '+' tag character
2. '#mark' syntax: Add mark with custom tag character ('#')
3. 'mark' syntax: Add mark with default '+' tag character

The comments make it easier to understand the string manipulation:
- ${1:0:1} extracts first character
- ${1:1} extracts everything after first character
- [[:punct:]] matches punctuation characters for custom tag chars

This improves code maintainability without changing functionality.
