Applied safer quoting practices throughout scripts (linting pass).

Major quoting improvements across multiple scripts for safety and style:
- Double-quoted all variable expansions ("$var" instead of $var)
- Properly quoted git revisions like '@{upstream}'
- Fixed variable tests like [ -z "${REPLY-}" ]
- Applied to: git-delete-both.sh, git-delorean.sh, git-env.sh, git-ignore.sh,
  git-mark.sh, git-push-interactive.sh, git-rebase-retag.sh

These changes prevent word splitting and globbing issues when variables contain
special characters or spaces.
