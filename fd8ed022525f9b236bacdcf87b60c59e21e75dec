Cleanup: Removed non-.sh versions of git-* files.

Deleted the original versions of git-arch, git-mebase, git-parents, and
git-resolve that didn't have .sh extensions, keeping only the .sh versions
for consistency.

This was done because the project standardized on .sh extensions for shell scripts.
