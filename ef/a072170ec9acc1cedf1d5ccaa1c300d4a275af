Added git-sync.sh for managing "sync tags" for repository synchronization.

Created utility script for syncing draft work across machines using tags instead
of branches. Addresses the pain point of managing temporary branches and force
pushes when syncing incomplete work across systems.

Key concept: "sync tags" replace temporary sync branches:
- Tag format: sync/<branch-name>/<iso-8601-timestamp>
- Avoids branch management overhead
- No need for force-rewriting history
- Clear timestamp-based versioning prevents ambiguity
- Reduces chance of naming conflicts

The script creates a sync tag for the current branch with UTC timestamp and
pushes it to origin, allowing easy synchronization without the complexity of
branch management or history rewriting.
