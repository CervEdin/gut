Added fallback to handle detached HEAD during rebase in git-arch.

Problem: During a rebase, HEAD is detached so 'git symbolic-ref' fails to return
a branch name, causing git-arch to fail.

Solution: When git-symbolic-ref fails, assume we're in a rebase and extract the
branch name from .git/rebase-merge/head-name file, which git writes during rebase.

Implementation notes:
- Falls back to this method only when symbolic-ref fails
- Parses the file path to extract branch name
- Allows archiving tags during rebase workflow

Future consideration: Author notes this is a hack and suggests reflog might be
a better long-term solution for detecting rebase state.
