Applied style convention: lowercase variables in git-resolve.

Changed variable names from uppercase FILES to lowercase files throughout
git-resolve.sh to follow the project's style convention that user-defined
variables should be lowercase (uppercase is typically reserved for environment
variables and constants).

This improves code consistency and follows shell scripting best practices where:
- Environment variables: uppercase (PATH, HOME, USER)
- Script-local variables: lowercase (files, temp_dir, count)

The change is purely stylistic with no functional impact.
