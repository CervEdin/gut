Fixed git-delorean topological sort bug.

Problem: Using 'git rev-list --no-walk' doesn't produce topologically sorted
commit list, so git-delorean was finding incorrect parent commits.

Solution: Changed to 'git rev-list --topo-order' and grep the output for
correct topological ordering.

Reference: Stack Overflow discussion on proper topological sorting of commits.

This fix ensures git-delorean identifies the correct commits to create
fixup commits for.
