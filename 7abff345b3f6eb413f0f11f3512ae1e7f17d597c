Add git-pp: Interactive push helper with force-push support.

git-pp facilitates pushing by:
1. Showing a graph log of commits that differ between HEAD and upstream
2. Prompting user to confirm push
3. If push fails, detecting non-fatal errors and offering force-push option

Designed primarily to enable safe force pushing - shows the changes before
committing to the push, allows recovery if something goes wrong.

Useful for workflows where force-pushing is common (e.g., interactive rebase
workflows, amended commits).
