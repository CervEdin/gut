Separated listing of pruneable branches into git-gone-local script.

Problem: git-prune-local previously combined two concerns - identifying branches
where the remote is gone AND automatically deleting them. This made it harder to
audit which branches would be deleted before executing the removal.

Solution: Extracted the listing logic into a separate git-gone-local.sh script
that identifies tracking branches with [gone] status. This allows users to:
- First run 'git gone-local' to see which branches will be pruned
- Then pipe to 'git branch -D' for actual deletion

This follows Unix philosophy: single responsibility and composability. The
refactored git-prune-local now simply calls git gone-local and pipes to xargs
for deletion, making both scripts reusable independently.
