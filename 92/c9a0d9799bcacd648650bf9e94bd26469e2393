Limited safe-mode (strict bash) to bash-shebang files only.

Problem: The debug target added strict mode (set -euxo pipefail) to all shell
scripts, but 'set' is a bash builtin. POSIX shells like dash don't support it and
exit with an error.

Solution: Added filter in debug target to check shebang before adding strict mode:
- Tests if shebang is #!/bin/bash with first sed expression
- Only adds set -euxo pipefail if bash shebang is found
- Skips POSIX shell scripts (#!/bin/sh)

This allows debug mode to work on bash-only scripts while preserving POSIX
compatibility for sh scripts.

Author's TODO: suggests using .bash extension for bash-specific scripts instead
of shebang parsing would be cleaner.
