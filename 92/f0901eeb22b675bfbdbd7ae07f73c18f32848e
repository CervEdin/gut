Added git-rebase-next utility to get SHA of next rebase item.

Created new script that retrieves the SHA of the next item in the rebase todo
list. This is useful during rebase when you want to compare, peek at, or cherry-
pick things from the next commit without fully completing the current rebase step.

Implementation: Uses sed to extract the SHA from the first line of
.git/rebase-merge/git-rebase-todo

Author's TODO: Notes that edge cases (empty todo, non-SHA lines) should be handled.
