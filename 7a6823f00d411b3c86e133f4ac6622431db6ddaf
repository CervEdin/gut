Changed base branch from hardcoded 'main' to 'origin/HEAD' for PR messages.

This makes the script more portable across repositories that use different
default branch names (master, main, develop, trunk, etc.).

origin/HEAD is a symbolic ref that points to the default branch of the remote,
automatically set during 'git clone' and updated with 'git remote set-head'.

This change means the script will work correctly regardless of the repository's
default branch naming convention.
