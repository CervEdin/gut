Improved usability by allowing shorthand branch names as arguments.

Instead of requiring 'refs/heads/feature-branch', users can now just pass
'feature-branch' and the script will automatically expand it to the full ref.

The implementation:
- Extracts the last argument
- Checks if it starts with 'refs/'
- If not, rebuilds the argument list with 'refs/heads/' prepended to the last arg
- Uses sed '$d' to remove last line (portable POSIX approach)

The TODO suggests making it more sophisticated by validating if the shortform
is actually a valid ref before transformation.
