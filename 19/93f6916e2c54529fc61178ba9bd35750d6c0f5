Added git-wsl.sh for syncing git repos between Windows and WSL.

Created utility script for Windows Subsystem for Linux users who maintain the
same repository on both Windows host and WSL. WSL has slow access to Windows
files, so this script helps keep them in sync.

The script:
- Detects if running on Windows (checks $OSTYPE for "msys")
- If on Windows: clones or pulls the repo into WSL, adds remotes for both systems
- If on WSL: adds remote for Windows location at /mnt/c/Users/$USER/repos/
- Fetches from the other system's remote to keep in sync

This enables developers to work on the repo in both environments, syncing changes
between them using git fetch from the appropriate remote.
