Improved git-ignore to skip empty first line when no arguments.

When git-ignore is called without arguments, stdin is empty, which would
result in an empty first line in .gitignore. Added sed filter to remove it.

Reordered cat arguments to put new entries first.

TODO: Author notes this could be improved.
