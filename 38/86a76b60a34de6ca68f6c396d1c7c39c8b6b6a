Changed git-mark tag character from # to @.

Reason: '#' has special meaning in bash (comments), causing issues.
'@' works more reliably in bash contexts.

This changes the branch marking convention from '#mark/branchname' to
'@mark/branchname'. Updated all references in git-mark.sh to use the new
tag_char variable.

Yes. Probably # was a bad default

Updated git-mark comments for tag character (fixup commit).

Updated comment in git-mark.sh from referring to '#mark' to '$tag_char mark'
for consistency with the tag character change from # to @.

Also changed hardcoded "#$mark/" to variable "$tag_char$mark/" in branch
rename command.

Seems like there's a dupe commit
