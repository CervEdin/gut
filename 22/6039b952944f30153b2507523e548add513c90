Added idempotency check to git-arch - only creates tag if it doesn't exist.

Changes prevent creating duplicate archive tags for the same commit:
- Before: Would always create a new tag even if one already exists
- After: Checks if tag exists first, returns existing tag name if found

Also outputs the tag name (created or existing) to stdout:
- Allows the tag name to be captured and piped to other commands
- Enables scripting workflows that depend on the tag identifier

This makes git-arch safer and more composable in shell pipelines.
