Fixed unbound variable check in git-search-replace.

Problem: Used unquoted '$3' in parameter expansion test [ -z "$3" ], which
violates bash strict mode (set -u). With strict mode enabled, accessing an
undefined variable causes a script exit.

Solution: Changed to [ -z "${3}" ] syntax which properly references the variable
with brace expansion, making the intent explicit and satisfying strict mode.

This is a safeguard for scripts running under strict mode (-u flag) which treats
unset variables as errors. The braces make variable expansion explicit.
