Fixed Makefile HOME variable expansion.

Problem: Used $${HOME} (double-dollar syntax) in Makefile variable assignment,
which doesn't expand correctly. Make treats $$ as escaped $, so the variable
becomes {HOME} instead of expanding to user's home directory.

Solution: Changed to ${HOME} (single-dollar) which properly expands the HOME
environment variable during Makefile evaluation.
