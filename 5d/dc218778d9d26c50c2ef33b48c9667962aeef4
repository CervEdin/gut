Applied safer quoting practices and linting to git-delorean.

Improved code quality and safety:
- Added proper double quotes around variable expansions ("$revspec", "$working_tree_sha")
- Split long command lines (xargs and git blame) for readability
- Added blank line for visual separation
- Used here-strings properly: <<< "$lines" moved to beginning of pipeline

These changes follow shell best practices for quoting and reduce risk of word
splitting issues with special characters in variables.
