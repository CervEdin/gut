Fixed shellcheck SC2124: Don't assign array to string variable.

Problem: Assigning array "$@" to string variable branches="$@" causes arrays to
be collapsed into single string.

Solution: Used printf to properly convert array to newline-separated string:
- Before: branches="$@"
- After: branches=$(printf '%s\n' "$@")

This preserves each array element on its own line, allowing proper iteration
over multiple branches in git-mark.sh.
