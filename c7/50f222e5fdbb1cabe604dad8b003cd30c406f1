Made 'all' the default Makefile target.

Added explicit 'default: all' target to Makefile to make 'all' the default
target that runs when just 'make' is invoked without arguments.

This is a usability improvement so users don't need to specify 'make all' - they
can just run 'make' and get the expected behavior of building everything.
