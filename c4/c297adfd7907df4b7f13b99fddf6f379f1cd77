Made git-delorean work relative to current directory.

Removed hardcoded repository root navigation:
- Deleted: git_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) and cd "$git_root"
- Added: --relative flag to git diff

This makes git-delorean respect the user's current working directory, only
processing staged changes relative to where the command was invoked. This allows
targeted fixup commit creation in subdirectories rather than always operating
on the entire repository.
