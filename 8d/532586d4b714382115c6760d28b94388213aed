Made git-arch POSIX shell compatible.

Converted git-arch from bash-specific to POSIX sh:
- Changed shebang from #!/bin/bash to #!/bin/sh
- Replaced [ "$var" == value ] with [ "$var" = value ] (POSIX standard)
- Replaced [[ -z "$var" ]] with [ -z "$var" ] (bash-specific double brackets)

This allows git-arch to run on any POSIX-compliant shell (dash, zsh, etc.)
rather than requiring bash, improving portability and reducing dependencies.
