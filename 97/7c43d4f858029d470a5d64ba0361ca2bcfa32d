Added git-mark.sh: Add marks to branch names for organization.

Allows marking branches with prefixes for workflow organization.

Example:
- Current branch: main
- git mark under-review -> renames to under-review/main
- Idempotent: calling again doesn't duplicate the mark

Uses sed to strip existing mark and prepends the new one.

Improved git-mark error message for clarity (fixup commit).

Minor improvement to git-mark error message:
- Before: "Fatal: argument needed"
- After: "Fatal: argument needed (a mark name)"

Makes it clearer what argument the user should provide when git-mark is called
without arguments.

Further refined git-mark error message (double fixup commit).

Additional refinement to the error message:
- Before: "Fatal: argument needed (a tag name)"
- After: "Fatal: argument needed (a mark name)"

Changes terminology from "tag name" to "mark name" for accuracy, since the
argument specifies what mark/character to use, not a tag. This fixup improves
clarity of the user-facing error message.
