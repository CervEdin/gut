Match conflict markers only at the start of lines in git-resolve.

Commit message: "Matching only avoids matching some non conflict markers."
Clarification: Matching only at line start avoids false positives where these
patterns might appear elsewhere in file content.

Note: The marker length (default 7 characters) is configurable via git config.

TODO: Read the actual marker patterns from git configuration instead of
hardcoding the 7-character pattern.
