Changed git-mark tag character from # to @.

Reason: '#' has special meaning in bash (comments), causing issues.
'@' works more reliably in bash contexts.

This changes the branch marking convention from '#mark/branchname' to
'@mark/branchname'. Updated all references in git-mark.sh to use the new
tag_char variable.

Yes. Probably # was a bad default
