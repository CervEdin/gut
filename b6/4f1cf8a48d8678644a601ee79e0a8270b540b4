Fixed git-fetch-ff to exclude checked-out worktrees from fast-forward.

Problem: Worktrees are checked-out branches in git worktree (allows multiple
working trees from same repo). Attempting fast-forward on worktree branches fails
because they're currently checked out and cannot be updated without switching.

Solution: Uses set subtraction via comm to exclude worktree branches:
- First query all refs/heads/**/* branches
- Use git worktree list --porcelain to identify checked-out branches
- Extract branch refs from worktree output (branch prefix lines)
- Use comm -23 to compute set difference (branches minus worktrees)
- Pass filtered branches to the normal fast-forward logic

This allows fast-forward to skip worktree branches that are currently checked out,
while processing all other tracking branches normally.

Note: Author flags this as overly complicated and suggests splitting worktree
handling into a separate script for better separation of concerns.
