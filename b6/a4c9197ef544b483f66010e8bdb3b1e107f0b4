Replaced legacy backtick syntax with $(...) notation (SC2006 shellcheck).

Problem: Bash backticks for command substitution `` are legacy syntax that's
harder to read and nest.

Solution: Replaced with modern $(...) syntax:
- Before: `cat $file`
- After: $(cat "$file")

Also fixed related quoting issues where variables in backticks lacked quotes.

Applied to: git-rebase-retag.sh, git-stash-drop-range.sh

The modern syntax is more readable and easier to nest in complex commands.
