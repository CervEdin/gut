Whitespace formatting improvements and added git-stash-inspector.sh:

1. git-branch-status.sh: Reformatted for readability
   - Split long git for-each-ref command across multiple lines
   - Added tab indentation for continuation lines
   - Improves code readability and maintainability

2. git-stash-inspector.sh: New script to inspect stashes
   - Filters stashes related to a specific branch using --grep
   - Parses stash output to extract branch, commit hash, and title
   - Shows stash statistics and diffs for selected branch
   - Useful for managing WIP stashes across multiple branches

The stash inspector helps visualize what's in stashes before restoring them.
