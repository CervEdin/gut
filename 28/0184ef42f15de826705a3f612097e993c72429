Added stdin support to git-resolve for processing piped conflict markers.

Enhancement: git-resolve now accepts conflict-marked content from stdin, enabling
use in pipelines. Users can pipe conflict markers directly to git-resolve without
using intermediate files.

Usage: Either specify - or /dev/stdin explicitly as the file argument:
  cat file_with_conflicts | git resolve --ours -
  git show conflict_marker_output | git resolve --theirs /dev/stdin

Implementation:
- Added case statement handling '-' and '/dev/stdin' specially
- For stdin input: uses sed directly on /dev/stdin and exits
- For file input: uses existing ffiles() logic with xargs/find
- Removed the file existence check for stdin (since it can't be pre-validated)

Design notes from author:
- Considered auto-detecting stdin, but typical input is "." or ":/"
- Tools like 'ifne' don't work reliably for this
- Explicit '-' or '/dev/stdin' is common practice (like grep, sed, etc.)
