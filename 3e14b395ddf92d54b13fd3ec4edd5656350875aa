Added sorting by committerdate to git-branch-status output.

The --sort='committerdate' flag orders branches from oldest to newest based on
their most recent commit date. This makes it easier to:
- Identify stale branches that haven't been updated recently
- See recently active branches at the bottom of the output
- Identify candidates for cleanup and archival

Without sorting, branches appeared in arbitrary order (usually creation date or
alphabetical). Sorting by committerdate provides useful workflow insights.
