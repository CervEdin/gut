Added git-fetch-ff.sh: Fast-forward all local tracking branches from remote.

Problem: Typical git fetch updates local tracking branches, but requires checking
out branches to fast-forward the local branch to match remote. This is inefficient
for updating multiple branches at once.

Solution: Created git-fetch-ff utility that:
- Lists all local branches and their tracking status relative to remote
- Filters branches that are behind their remote (using sed on tracking status)
- Uses awk to consolidate multiple remotes for the same branch
- Invokes git fetch with appropriate remote references to fast-forward locally

The script uses sophisticated text processing:
- column -t for formatting reference info
- sed to extract branches that are behind
- awk to aggregate branches by remote
- xargs to invoke git fetch with appropriate refs

This allows fast-forwarding all branches without checking them out, similar to
`git fetch --all` but operating on already-configured tracking branches.
