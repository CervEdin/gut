Refactored Makefile to use order-only prerequisites for directories.

Major Makefile cleanup using order-only prerequisites (| syntax):

Problem: Directory targets (bin/, $(INSTALL_DIR)) were regular prerequisites, so
updated timestamps would trigger unnecessary rebuilds even when directory didn't
change.

Solution: Changed to order-only prerequisites using |:
- Directories only trigger builds if they're missing (not if newer)
- Excluded from automatic variables like $^
- Removed trailing slashes from directory names (added back in rules)
- Consolidated directory creation with mkdir -p
- Moved pipe syntax to individual rules

Example: bin/%.sh : %.sh | bin (bin only matters if missing, not if changed)

Also simplified directory creation targets with ; syntax for one-liners.

This is a Makefile best-practice improvement that reduces unnecessary rebuilds.
