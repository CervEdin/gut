Fixed POSIX shell compatibility in git-fetch-ff (SC3001 shellcheck).

Problem: Used bash-specific process substitution <(command) which is undefined
in POSIX sh.

Solution: Replaced with temporary file approach:
- Create temporary file with mktemp
- Write worktree list to file with redirection (>)
- Use comm with file instead of process substitution

This makes git-fetch-ff compatible with POSIX sh while maintaining the same
logic.
