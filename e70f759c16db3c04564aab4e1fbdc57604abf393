Added --update (-u) flag to git add to ensure only tracked files are staged.

This is correct because merge conflicts can only occur in files that are already
tracked by git. Untracked files (new files that exist in the working directory
but aren't in either branch being merged) cannot have conflicts.

The --update flag prevents accidentally staging untracked files that happen to
match the pathspec but aren't part of the merge conflict resolution.
