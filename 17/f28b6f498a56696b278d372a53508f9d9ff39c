Removed strict mode (set -euo pipefail) from git-delorean.

Removed the bash strict mode setting from git-delorean to allow the script to
continue execution even if intermediate commands fail.

This gives more control over error handling in the complex pipeline that involves
git blame, rev-list, and xargs operations.
