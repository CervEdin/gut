Fixed shellcheck warnings about read without -r flag (SC2162).

Added -r flag to all read commands in:
- git-delete-both.sh
- git-mebase.sh
- git-rebase-retag.sh

The -r flag prevents read from interpreting backslash escape sequences, which
can mangle backslashes in input. This is important for handling file paths and
other data that may contain backslashes.
