Fixed Makefile debug recipe sed script.

The previous sed script had incorrect assumptions about strict mode order.
Corrected to enforce proper order: 'set -euxo pipefail'.

Also split sed script across multiple lines for better readability.

Note: Some scripts may have issues with pipefail enabled.

I may have gotten rid of this at a later stage.
Bash 'strict mode' has issues. But some of this _is_ useful when _debugging_.
This should probably enabled in something like `make install-debug` or similar.
