Fixed Makefile debug recipe sed script.

The previous sed script had incorrect assumptions about strict mode order.
Corrected to enforce proper order: 'set -euxo pipefail'.

Also split sed script across multiple lines for better readability.

Note: Some scripts may have issues with pipefail enabled.
