Added explicit 'exit 0' to ensure script always exits successfully.

The issue: In bash, a script's exit code is the exit code of the last command
that executed. If the for loop's last iteration:
- Hits a 'continue' statement (when a branch already has the mark)
- The test condition evaluates to false

Then the script would exit with status 1 (false) or whatever the last command
returned, even though nothing actually went wrong.

Adding 'exit 0' ensures the script always exits with success status (0) when
it completes normally, regardless of the final loop iteration's outcome.

This is a common pattern in scripts where the final command might not indicate
the overall success of the script.
