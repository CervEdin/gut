Made Makefile debug recipe only target shell files.

Limited debug recipe to shell scripts (*.sh) since the sed script would break
on sed scripts (*.sed).

Added shell_files and shell_programs variables to Makefile for targeting.

This should explicitly mention it's for shell (bash only?) `set -u` type options.
Now that I think of it, maybe an environment variable could control this?
Or there maybe other better ways to do this. We may need to think about it more.
