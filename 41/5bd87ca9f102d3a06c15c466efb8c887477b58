Why duck typing instead of alternatives:

1. Platform detection (uname) would require enumerating all BSD variants
2. Testing for --version flag is a proxy test, not testing the actual behavior
3. sed -i.bak approach leaves backup files that need cleanup (tricky with xargs)
4. Duck typing tests the exact behavior we need with negligible overhead

The test creates a temp file and tries 'sed -i' (GNU syntax). If it succeeds,
we use GNU syntax; if it fails, we use BSD syntax 'sed -i ""'. This works
across all platforms without needing to know which platform we're on.

Null-delimited xargs pattern (tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0):

This approach properly handles filenames with:
- Spaces
- Newlines
- Other special characters

xargs -d '\n' (GNU-specific) only handles newlines in filenames but fails on
other special characters. The null-delimited approach is:
- Fully portable (works on BSD and GNU)
- More robust (null bytes can't appear in filenames)
- Standard practice for handling arbitrary filenames in shell scripts
