Further refined git-mark error message (double fixup commit).

Additional refinement to the error message:
- Before: "Fatal: argument needed (a tag name)"
- After: "Fatal: argument needed (a mark name)"

Changes terminology from "tag name" to "mark name" for accuracy, since the
argument specifies what mark/character to use, not a tag. This fixup improves
clarity of the user-facing error message.
