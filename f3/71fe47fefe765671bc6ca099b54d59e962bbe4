Fixed git-fetch-ff regression with remote ref formatting.

Problem: Previous commit changed upstream reference format to %(upstream) which
includes the full refs/remotes/origin/branch format. However, git fetch expects
just the branch name when the remote is specified explicitly.

For example:
  Wrong: git fetch origin refs/remotes/origin/branch:branch
  Right: git fetch origin branch:branch

Solution: Changed format string from %(upstream) to %(upstream:remoteref) which
provides just the remote branch name without the refs/remotes/ prefix, allowing
proper git fetch invocations.

This is marked as a fixup commit for commit 0120 that fixes the regression it
introduced.
