Add git-env: Environment setup script with command shortcuts.

Creates shell functions as convenient shortcuts for common git commands:
- aa: git add --all
- ss: git status
- sk: git rebase --skip
- dff: git diff
- sdf: git diff --staged
- cm: git commit -m

Also enables commit.verbose in git config for detailed commit messaging.

Toggle on/off: running the script again will unset all functions and
disable the environment. Marks status with GIT_ENV variable.

Useful for streamlining repetitive git commands during active development.
