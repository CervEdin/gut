Background on date --utc vs -u:

GNU date introduced long options like --utc as extensions. BSD date (and POSIX)
only supports short options. The -u flag has been part of POSIX since early
versions and is universally supported.

Both commands produce identical output - UTC/GMT timestamps. The only difference
is the option syntax.
