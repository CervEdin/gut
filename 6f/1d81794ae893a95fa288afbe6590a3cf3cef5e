Improved Makefile ls target output using $(info) function.

Changed ls target from using 'echo' to using Make's built-in $(info) function:
- $(info) prints during evaluation, not during execution
- Provides clearer labeled output with descriptive messages
- Added .PHONY declaration for ls to ensure it always runs

Before: Bare echo output
After: Labeled output like "installed programs are: ..."

This improves the user experience when checking what's installed.
