Add git-env: Environment setup script with command shortcuts.

Creates shell functions as convenient shortcuts for common git commands:
- aa: git add --all
- ss: git status
- sk: git rebase --skip
- dff: git diff
- sdf: git diff --staged
- cm: git commit -m

Also enables commit.verbose in git config for detailed commit messaging.

Toggle on/off: running the script again will unset all functions and
disable the environment. Marks status with GIT_ENV variable.

Useful for streamlining repetitive git commands during active development.

This is actually an interesting script. Sometimes it's nice to skip `git `
before aliases. But maybe there's a better way, like taking aliases from
`git config` and using that as aliases in the shell. We may consider checking
for collisions with already defined functions/aliases/executables. We may also
considering a `g <alias>`, which would be simpler, while still requiring a few
more strokes.
