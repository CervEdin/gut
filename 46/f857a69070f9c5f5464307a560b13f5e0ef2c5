Created git-rebase-retag.sh script that updates tags during mebase:
- Identifies which commits are being rebased
- Moves tags that were on old commits to their new commit positions
- Ensures tag references remain valid after rebase

TODO: This should probably be configurable. Not even sure anymore this makes sense.
Probably better to use branches for this purpose.
