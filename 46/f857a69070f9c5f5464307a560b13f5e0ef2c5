Added automatic tag retagging during mebase (interactive rebase).

Problem: During a normal rebase, tags don't move with the rebased commits, so
they stay pointing at the old history. This breaks tag references.

Solution: Created git-rebase-retag.sh script that updates tags during mebase:
- Identifies which commits are being rebased
- Moves tags that were on old commits to their new commit positions
- Ensures tag references remain valid after rebase

Integration:
- Modified git-mebase to call git-rebase-retag after rebase completes
- Preserves tag semantics during rebase workflow

This feature is specifically for mebase (and its derivatives) to keep tags
in sync with the rebased commit history, avoiding orphaned tag references.

TODO: This should probably be configurable. Not even sure anymore this makes sense.
Probably better to use branches for this purpose.
