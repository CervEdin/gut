Fixed Makefile ${HOME} variable expansion.

Changed INSTALL_DIR from $${HOME}/bin/ to ${HOME}/bin/.

The double dollar sign $${HOME} was escaping the variable in Make, preventing
proper expansion to the user's home directory. Single ${HOME} allows Make to
correctly expand to the home directory path.

Should probably be a fixup commit
