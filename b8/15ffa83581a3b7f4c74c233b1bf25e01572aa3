Refactored git-resolve to conditionally build sed script instead of executing.

Problem: The sed script to remove conflict markers was constructed differently
for each case (both/ours/theirs) but the execution logic was duplicated across
all three paths.

Solution: Separated concerns by:
- Building the sed_script variable conditionally based on which mode is selected
- Executing the sed script once after the conditional block
- Adding clear comments documenting what each case does

This reduces code duplication and makes it clearer that the only difference
between the three modes is the sed script pattern - the execution is identical.
