Changed archive tag naming from 'archive/branch-date' to 'archive/branch/date'.

Changes the decorated tag convention for better hierarchical organization:

Old format: archive/branch-2022-03-08T14.17.03
New format: archive/branch/2022-03-08T14.17.03

Benefits:
- Hierarchical structure with slashes naturally groups tags
- Encodes hierarchical clarity (branch as directory, dates as files)
- May improve performance in git bash

Commit message claims this enables better shell completion, but the hierarchy
is more about semantic clarity than functional shell completion differences.
