Changed archive tag naming from 'archive/branch-date' to 'archive/branch/date'.

Changes the decorated tag convention for better hierarchical organization:

Old format: archive/branch-2022-03-08T14.17.03
New format: archive/branch/2022-03-08T14.17.03

Benefits:
- Hierarchical structure with slashes naturally groups tags
- Better shell completion: 'git show archive/branch/' shows all archives for branch
- Cleaner tag listing in git tools that support path-like hierarchy
- Matches directory structure conventions (branch as directory, dates as files)

This is primarily a UX improvement for shell workflow and tag navigation.

I don't think this is any different.

I think this may have been because of better performance in git bash.

I don't think this is any different. It's more about encoding hierarchical clarity.
