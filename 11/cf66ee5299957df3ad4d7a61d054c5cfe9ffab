Added initial README.md documenting the gut project.

The README establishes the project's purpose and philosophy:
- Collection of git helper scripts for personal workflow
- Aims for POSIX compliance and git project conventions
- Scripts designed for specific use cases and personal preferences
- Open to PRs but reflects author's needs and taste

Also includes basic installation instructions: place scripts in PATH (like ~/bin/)
and invoke as git subcommands (e.g., 'git arch').

Sets expectations: no warranty or guarantees provided with these tools.
