Added committerdate to git-branch-status output for better branch visibility.

The committerdate:short format shows when each branch was last committed to,
helping identify:
- Stale branches that haven't been updated recently
- Active branches with recent commits
- When to clean up old feature branches

Output now shows: branch name | commit date | tracking status | remote name

This complements the existing --sort='committerdate' to display branches in
chronological order with their dates visible, making branch management easier.
