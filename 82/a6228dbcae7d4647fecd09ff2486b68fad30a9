Refactored Makefile with proper rules and recipes.

Major Makefile improvements:
- Uses wildcard expansion to find *.sh and *.sed files
- Implements proper build rules (bin directory)
- Separate rules for .sh and .sed file installation
- Added INSTALL_DIR customization with default to ~/bin/
- Symlink creation for installed programs (removes .sh extension)
- Added uninstall and clean targets
- Added debug target to add 'set -euox' to scripts
- Updated README with installation instructions

Follows GNU Make best practices with proper rules, prerequisites, and recipes.
