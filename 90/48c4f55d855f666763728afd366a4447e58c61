Fixed git-resolve to handle file paths with whitespace.

Problem: The ffiles function and subsequent invocations used unquoted variables
($@ and $FILES), which breaks when file paths contain spaces or special characters.

Changes:
- Quoted $@ in git ls-files invocation to preserve path integrity
- Rewrote ffiles function to use proper quoting for "$@"
- Quoted "$FILES" variable in the git add command at the end

This ensures merge conflict resolution works correctly with files that have
spaces in their names. The fix follows proper shell quoting practices for
handling arbitrary filenames.
