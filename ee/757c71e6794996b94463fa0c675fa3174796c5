Made git-ignore case-insensitive sorting.

Changed sort flag from -n (numeric) to -n -i (numeric and ignore-case) to ensure
.gitignore entries are sorted case-insensitively.

This means entries like "Foo" and "foo" are treated as equivalent during sorting,
preventing duplicates when the same pattern appears with different casing.
