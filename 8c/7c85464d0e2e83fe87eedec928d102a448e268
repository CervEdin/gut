About the sed command quoting:

Old: sed -i s@"$search_for"@"$replace_with"@g
New: $SED_INPLACE "s@$search_for@$replace_with@g"

The change removes quotes around the variables inside the sed command and instead
quotes the entire sed script. This is better because:

1. Sed doesn't recognize quotes within addresses/patterns - they become literal
2. The @ delimiter is used (instead of /) to avoid conflicts with slashes in search/replace strings
3. Variables expand before sed sees them, so quoting the whole script is sufficient
4. With duck typing, we can use xargs directly instead of sh -c, eliminating a layer of quoting complexity

Note: This approach works because @ is used as delimiter. If the search/replace
strings contain @, users would need to choose a different delimiter or escape it.
