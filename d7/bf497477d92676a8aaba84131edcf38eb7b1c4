Added git-stash-drop-range.sh: Drop a range of stashes.

New script to delete multiple stashes by index range instead of one at a time.

Usage: git stash-drop-range <start> <end>

Implementation: Loops from start to end inclusive, dropping the stash at
index start each iteration (since dropping shifts indices down).

Reference: Stack Overflow answer #72288570

Useful for bulk cleanup of accumulated stashes.
