Renamed makefile to Makefile per GNU standards.

Followed GNU conventions by renaming the build file from lowercase 'makefile' to
uppercase 'Makefile', which is the standard expected by make and build tools.

This is a simple rename (100% similarity) with no functional changes - it allows
users to run 'make' instead of 'make -f makefile'.
