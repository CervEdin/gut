Added make help target with documented target listing.

Enhancement: Replaced 'ls' target with 'help' that provides user-friendly
documentation.

Added two new features:
1. help target with clear descriptions of installation info
2. list-make-targets.awk script that parses Makefile for documented targets

Documentation format: Target documentation is marked with ## comments preceding
the target:
```
## This is what the target does
target:
  command
```

The awk script:
- Parses Makefile for ^## documentation lines
- Extracts target names and associates with docs
- Formats with color (green for targets)
- Displays relevant targets users are likely to run

Documented targets in this commit: all, uninstall, help, debug

This gives users accessible documentation within 'make help' without needing to
read the Makefile directly.
