Made git-mark tag character customizable (optional first parameter).

Users can now specify a custom tag character as the first parameter:
- 'git mark gone' -> defaults to '+' as tag character
- 'git mark #gone' -> uses '#' as tag character
- 'git mark @gone' -> uses '@' as tag character
- Detects punctuation characters using bash regex [[:punct:]]

Also support deletion with '-mark' syntax (defaults tag to '+').

Changed default from hardcoded '@' to '+' since both @ and # have issues with bash.
