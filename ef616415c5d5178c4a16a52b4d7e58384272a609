Added proper error handling for branch rename failures in git-mark.sh.

Previously, if 'git branch -m' failed (e.g., due to branch name conflicts or
invalid branch names), the script would silently continue. Now it:
- Captures the exit code
- Prints an error message to stderr indicating which branch failed
- Exits with the same error code from git

This makes debugging easier and prevents the script from appearing to succeed
when it actually failed.
