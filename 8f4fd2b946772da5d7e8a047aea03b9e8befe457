Add optional file-spec to git-resolve for selective conflict resolution.

git-resolve now accepts a git file-spec argument to control which files
are processed for conflict resolution, allowing users to resolve conflicts
in specific files or directories rather than everything.

This makes the script more flexible for handling large repos with conflicts
across many files - users can resolve them incrementally by path.
