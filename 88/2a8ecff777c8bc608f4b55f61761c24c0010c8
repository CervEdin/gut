Added support for diff3 and zdiff3 conflict marker styles.

Problem: git-resolve only handled the default "merge" conflict style markers
(<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>). Git supports alternative conflict styles like:
- diff3: adds ||||||| marker with original text before =======
- zdiff3: variant of diff3

Solution: Updated sed script patterns to handle both merge and diff3/zdiff3:
- Changed simple = pattern to [|=] (pipe or equals) to match both = and ||||||
- Updated range patterns for "ours" mode to /^[|=]\{7\}/,/^>\{7\}/

This allows git-resolve to work with diff3 conflict style which includes more
context about the original state before the conflict, useful for understanding
how the conflict arose.
