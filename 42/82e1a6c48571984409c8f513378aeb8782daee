Added git-prune-local.sh: Prune local branches with gone upstream.

Deletes all local tracking branches where the remote has been deleted.

Algorithm:
1. Sets LC_ALL=C for consistent output across locales
2. Uses git for-each-ref to find branches with [gone] status
3. Extracts branch names and deletes them with git branch -D

POSIX compliant - works on both BSD and GNU systems.
