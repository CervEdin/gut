Resolved TODO: git-mebase now works with 10+ parent branches.

Removed a TODO comment indicating that git-mebase could only handle up to 9 parents.
The script has been enhanced to support any number of parent branches through
interactive selection.

It worked before. This only removes the TODO, verifying it works.
Not sure if this is because of changed behavior or not. If it's part of fixed behavior it should be a fixup of whatever fixed the issue
