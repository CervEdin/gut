# Gut

Gut is a collection of scripts for git.
Basically, it's a collection of git helper scripts that I use and that help me
in my usage of git.
I try and adher to conventions of the git-project and I aim for POSIX
compliance.
That said, these scripts are very much developed after my needs and personal taste.
PRs are welcome.

# Installation

1. Put files somewhere in path.
Like `~/bin/` or run `make INSTALL_DIR=/bin/ all`,
which copies them into `/bin/` or whichever `INSTALL_DIR` you specify.
2. Run command like so: `git arch`
3. ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’²

# Warranty

100% without any sort of warranty/guarantee.
