# Gut

Gut is a collection of scripts for git.
Basically, it's a collection of git helper scripts that I use and that help me
in my usage of git.
I try and adher to conventions of the git-project and I aim for POSIX
compliance.
That said, these scripts are very much developed after my needs and personal taste.
PRs are welcome.
