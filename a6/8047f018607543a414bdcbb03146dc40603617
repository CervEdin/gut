Improved git-fetch-ff to handle multiple local branches tracking same remote.

Problem: The previous implementation assumed a 1:1 mapping between local and remote
branches, but git supports multiple local branches tracking the same remote branch.
For example:
  local branch 'a' tracks 'origin/A'
  local branch 'b' also tracks 'origin/A'

Solution: Refactored to track relationships as upstream[remote][local]=upstream_branch:
- sed now captures local, remote, and upstream branch separately
- awk builds an associative array with remote/local pairs
- Generates fetch commands like: git fetch origin A:a A:b

This supports complex tracking configurations where multiple local branches track
the same remote branch, and ensures git fetch is called once per remote with all
applicable ref mappings.
