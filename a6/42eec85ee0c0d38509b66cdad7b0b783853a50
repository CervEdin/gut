Enhanced git-mark.sh with bash features, deletion, and multiple branches.

Major improvements to git-mark:
- Converted to bash (from POSIX sh) for variable substitution features
- Added support for deletion: 'git mark -mark-name' removes the mark
- Support for multiple branches: 'git mark name branch1 branch2 ...'
- Can overwrite existing marks on multiple branches

Mark format: #mark/branchname (e.g., #review/feature-x)

Note: Author comments that reverting to POSIX sh for compatibility may be
considered in the future.

Better to write:
- Added support for deletion: 'git mark -{mark-name}' removes the mark
otherwise it looks like a flag

Again, some of this looks maybe redundant.

TODO:
- What chars are valid? The script help should probably list them. Also, we
  should probably not allow -, even if supported.
