Added git-find-files utility for searching files across all refs.

Created script to find files matching grep patterns across all git references
(branches, tags, stashes, remotes) and sort results by author date.

Usefulness: When looking for a file, the script:
- Searches across all refs (not just current branch)
- Searches stashes, tags, and remote branches automatically
- Sorts results by author date of the commit containing the file
- Shows which ref contains the file and when it was last modified

Syntax: git find-files <grep-args>

This helps when you remember a file exists but don't recall which branch/tag
contains it or which is the latest version.
