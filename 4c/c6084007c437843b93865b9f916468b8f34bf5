Fixed extremely slow script due to network lookup issue in Git for Windows.

Problem: There's a strange issue with /bin/sh (bash in POSIX mode) under Git for
Windows that causes network lookups during script invocation, making git-search-replace
extremely slow. This was reported to the Git for Windows project:
https://groups.google.com/g/git-for-windows/c/HxJIyC2hvro

Workaround: Changed shebang from #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash. Using /bin/bash directly
avoids the network lookup issue and makes the script perform normally.

This is a platform-specific workaround for Git for Windows behavior and is marked as
a HACK comment, indicating it may be revisited if the underlying issue is fixed.
