Changed git-resolve default pathspec from repo root to current working directory.

Problem: Previously, git-resolve changed to the repository root with
`cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`, then used '.' as default, which meant
resolving conflicts in the entire repository regardless of where the user ran it.

Solution: Removed the cd command and kept the default as '.' (current working
directory). Now git-resolve respects the user's working directory, only operating
on files relative to where the command was invoked.

This is more intuitive and aligns with other git commands' behavior of respecting
the user's context. Users can still resolve all conflicts with `git resolve --ours :/`
if needed.
