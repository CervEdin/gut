Added --sparse flag to git add in git-resolve.

Using the --sparse flag when staging resolved files. This was added to address
warnings/issues encountered during testing when the flag was omitted.

TODO note: Verify that --sparse is the best approach for this use case and
ensure there are no side effects from using it.
