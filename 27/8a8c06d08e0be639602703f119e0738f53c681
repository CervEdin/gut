Major Makefile improvements including:
- Wildcard expansion for .sh and .sed files
- Proper build directory structure (bin/)
- Pattern rules for .sh and .sed files
- INSTALL_DIR variable with ~/bin/ default
- Symlink creation removing .sh extension
- uninstall and clean targets
- debug target for adding strict mode with -x

Follows professional Make standards with proper rules, prerequisites, recipes,
and variable usage.
