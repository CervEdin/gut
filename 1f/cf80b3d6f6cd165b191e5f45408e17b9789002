Fixed shellcheck SC2164: Added error handling for cd command.

Changed git-delorean.sh to check if cd succeeds:
- Before: cd "$git_root"
- After: cd "$git_root" || exit 1

This prevents the script from continuing if cd fails (e.g., if the git root
directory is deleted or inaccessible), which would cause subsequent commands
to operate in the wrong directory with potentially disastrous results.
