Hide archive tags from git-parents output.

Filters out archive tags (those matching 'archive/*' pattern) from the list
of potential rebase targets returned by git-parents.

Archive tags are snapshots created by git-arch and not appropriate targets
for interactive rebasing, so excluding them makes the parent list cleaner
and more useful for workflow.
