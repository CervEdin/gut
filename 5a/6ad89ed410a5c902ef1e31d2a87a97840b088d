Initial commit setting up the repository with GPL v3 license and basic files.

This is the foundation commit that established the git project, adding:
- LICENSE file (GPL v3)
- Basic project structure

This commit marks the start of the 'gut' project. While 'gut' didn't originally
stand for anything in particular, "git utility tools" serves as a useful
retroactive expansion of the name.
