Converted indentation from tabs to spaces in git-branch-status.sh.

Changed continuation lines in the git for-each-ref command from tab indentation
to 4-space indentation for consistency and improved readability.

This is a style-only change with no functional impact. Using spaces instead of
tabs is the modern standard in many codebases for script files.
