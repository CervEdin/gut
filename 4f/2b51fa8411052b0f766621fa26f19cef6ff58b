The two scripts referenced are:

- git-jump: A git contrib tool that integrates with editors to jump to
  specific locations (like merge conflicts, grep results, or diff hunks).
  Useful for workflow integration with vim/emacs quickfix lists.

- git-test: Spotify's tool for running tests on a range of commits to find
  which commit introduced a regression. Similar to git-bisect but for test
  suites rather than manual verification.

Both complement gut's scripts by providing additional workflow automation.
