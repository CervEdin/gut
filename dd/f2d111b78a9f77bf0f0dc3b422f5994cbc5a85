Fixed git-fetch-ff glob pattern to match nested branches.

Problem: The glob pattern 'refs/heads/*' only matches top-level branches in the
refs/heads/ namespace. It doesn't match branches at sub-levels like:
  release/x.y.z
  wip/nonsense
  feature/sub-feature/branch

These nested branches failed to be included in the fast-forward operation.

Solution: Changed glob pattern from 'refs/heads/*' to 'refs/heads/**/*' which
recursively matches all branches at any nesting level under refs/heads.

The ** pattern in git for-each-ref enables recursive matching, ensuring all
branches regardless of nesting depth are processed.
