Fixed git-fetch-ff to handle branches with local upstream tracking.

Problem: Local branches with local upstreams (tracking another local branch)
would fail because their remote is represented as '.' (current repo). The sed
regex and parsing logic didn't handle this edge case.

Solution: Changed format string in git for-each-ref:
- Now uses %(upstream:remotename) to get just the remote name explicitly
- Uses %(upstream:remoteref) for the full upstream reference (already includes remote:branch)
- Updated sed regex to handle tab-delimited format more robustly

This allows git-fetch-ff to handle the edge case of local branches with local
upstreams, though the author notes these might be worth excluding entirely.
