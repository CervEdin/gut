Fixed printf format string vulnerabilities (SC2059 shellcheck).

Problem: Used variables in printf format strings, which is unsafe and can cause
unexpected behavior if variables contain format specifiers.

Solution: Changed to use format specifiers in the format string, pass variables
as arguments:
- Before: printf "Invalid option: -$OPTARG\n" >&2
- After: printf -- 'Invalid option: -%s\n' "$OPTARG" >&2
- Also added -- to terminate option processing

Applied to: git-arch.sh, git-mebase.sh

This is a security best practice that prevents format string attacks.
