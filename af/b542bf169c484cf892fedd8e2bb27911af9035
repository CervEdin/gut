Added help/usage documentation to git-arch script.

Enhanced git-arch with comprehensive usage information:
- Added usage string explaining what archive tags are
- Added explanation of the naming convention: archive/<refname>/<date>
- Explained use cases (archiving old branches, persistent snapshots)
- Added help text handling for -h flag

This improves discoverability and usability of the script by providing users
with quick reference information about what archive tags do and how they work.
