Add git-delorean: Automatically creates fixup commits from staged changes.

git-delorean analyzes git blame information to find which commits modified
the staged lines, then creates fixup commits targeting those commits.

Example:
 1.a      (commit 1, not staged)
~1.b      (commit 1, staged changes)
~2.c      (commit 2, staged changes)
 1.d      (commit 1, not staged)

Results in:
- fixup! commit for commit 2 with content 'c'
- fixup! commit for commit 1 with content 'b'

This simplifies the workflow of incrementally fixing prior commits without
manual fixup commit creation.

DON'T BE REDUNDANT.

NB: This script can largely be replaced by `git absorb`, except it doesn't
support absorbing past merge commits and the author refuses to consider the
idea.
