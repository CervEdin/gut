Enhanced git-pp to offer force-push at the first prompt, not just after
a failed push attempt. This is useful when you know upfront that a force-push
is needed (e.g., after rebase or amendment).

Options:
- Push normally
- Force push immediately

Note: Cancel option is implicit in the prompt.

TODO: We should probably explain this implicit behavior.
