Add immediate force-push option to git-pp.

Enhanced git-pp to offer force-push at the first prompt, not just after
a failed push attempt. This is useful when you know upfront that a force-push
is needed (e.g., after rebase or amendment).

Offers three options:
- Push normally
- Force push immediately
- Cancel

Improves UX for workflows where force-pushing is common.
