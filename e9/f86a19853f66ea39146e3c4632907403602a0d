Fixed git-fetch-ff to handle branches with local upstream tracking.

Problem: Local branches with local upstreams (tracking another local branch) would
fail because their remote is represented as '.' (current repo). The sed regex and
parsing logic didn't handle this edge case.

Solution: Changed format string in git for-each-ref:
- Now uses %(upstream:remotename) to get just the remote name explicitly
- Uses %(upstream) for the full upstream reference (already includes remote:branch)
- Updated sed regex to handle tab-delimited format more robustly

This allows git-fetch-ff to handle the edge case of local branches with local
upstreams, though the author notes these might be worth excluding entirely.

Fixed git-fetch-ff regression with remote ref formatting.

Problem: Previous commit changed upstream reference format to %(upstream) which
includes the full refs/remotes/origin/branch format. However, git fetch expects
just the branch name when the remote is specified explicitly.

For example:
  Wrong: git fetch origin refs/remotes/origin/branch:branch
  Right: git fetch origin branch:branch

Solution: Changed format string from %(upstream) to %(upstream:remoteref) which
provides just the remote branch name without the refs/remotes/ prefix, allowing
proper git fetch invocations.

This is marked as a fixup commit for commit 0120 that fixes the regression it
introduced.
