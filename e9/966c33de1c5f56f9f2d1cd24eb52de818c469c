Fixed merge conflict when git-delorean has unstaged changes.

Problem: When running git-delorean on a file with both staged and unstaged
changes, the stash pop reintroduces a merge conflict.

Root cause: 'git commit --pathspec' commits all changes (staged + unstaged),
so the stash must save the working tree, then only keep staged changes.
When stash is popped later, the unstaged changes reintroduce conflicts.

Solution: Use 'git stash pop --index' to properly restore both staged and
unstaged changes to their respective stages without conflicts.
