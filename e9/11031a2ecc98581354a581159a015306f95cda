Fixed git-parents sorting for annotated tags.

Problem: Annotated tags don't have a committerdate, only creatordate. When
sorting by committerdate alone, annotated tags weren't sorted correctly.

Solution: Added secondary sort by creatordate to handle both:
- Commit refs: sorted by committerdate (when it was committed)
- Annotated tags: sorted by creatordate (when the tag was created)

This ensures both types of refs sort correctly in git-parents output.
