How the script works:

The script tracks all historical names of file(s) by:

1. Using 'git log --follow -M' to track files across renames
   - --follow: Continues history beyond renames
   - -M: Detects renames (default threshold 50% similarity)
   - --name-status: Shows R (rename) status with old/new names

2. AWK processing filters the rename history:
   - R[0-9]+ matches rename entries (R100, R95, etc. show % similarity)
   - For each rename, extracts both old name ($2) and new name ($3)
   - Uses seen[] array to track unique names and avoid duplicates
   - Handles other status codes (A/M/D) by extracting the filename ($2)

3. Optional start commit:
   - If first arg is a valid commit-ish, uses START..HEAD range
   - Otherwise searches entire history (HEAD)

Output shows the current path followed by all historical names it had,
useful for finding where code moved from or tracking file evolution.
