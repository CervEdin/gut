Applied bash variable naming convention to git-delorean.

Changed all local variables in git-delorean.sh to lowercase to follow bash
conventions as documented in the commit message.

Convention: Environment variables and shell internals are UPPERCASE, local
variables are lowercase to avoid conflicts.
