Fixed merge conflict in git-delorean with unstaged changes.

Problem: When a file has both staged and unstaged changes, git-delorean's
stash/pop workflow caused merge conflicts.

Root cause: git commit with filespec commits both staged and unstaged changes.
The script uses stash to isolate only staged changes, but popping the stash
later would merge the unstaged changes back, causing conflicts.

Solution: Pass --index flag to 'git stash pop' to properly restore staged
changes to the index while avoiding merge conflicts.
