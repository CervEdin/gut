Fixed missing git-rebase-indent.sed script.

Added the previously missing rebase-indent sed script that's used by
git-rebase-retag for formatting rebase todos.

Also:
- Updated git-rebase-retag to reference the script (currently hardcoded to ~/bin/)
- Updated Makefile to include .sed files in install target

TODO: Consider embedding the sed script directly in the .sh file instead of
requiring an external file dependency.
