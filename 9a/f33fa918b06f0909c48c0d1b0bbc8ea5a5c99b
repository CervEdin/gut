Made debug output conditional on bash debug mode (set -x).

Problem: The script always prints debug information to stderr about argument
parsing and file specs, which clutters output unless debugging is specifically
enabled.

Solution: Wrapped all printf debug statements with [[ $- =~ x ]] check, which
tests if the x flag is set in $- (bash options). This means debug output only
prints when the script is run with 'bash -x' or 'set -x' is enabled.

This allows users to get verbose output when needed without cluttering normal
script execution.
