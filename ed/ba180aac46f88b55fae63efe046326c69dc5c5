Fixed git-ignore sorting and deduplication.

Problem: Previous commit used incorrect flag -i (which had no effect) and didn't
remove duplicates when re-adding already ignored patterns.

Solution: Changed to proper sort flags:
- --ignore-case: for case-insensitive sorting (replaces incorrect -i)
- --unique: removes duplicate entries

This ensures .gitignore remains clean without case-sensitive duplicates, and
re-running git ignore with already-ignored patterns doesn't create duplicates.
