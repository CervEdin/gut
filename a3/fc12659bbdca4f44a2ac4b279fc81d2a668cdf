Fixed POSIX shell compatibility in git-branch-status.

Problem: Used ANSI-C quoting syntax $'\t' to specify a tab character. This syntax
is bash-specific and not POSIX-compliant, causing the script to fail in POSIX
shells like dash (used on some systems).

Solution: Replaced $'\t' with a literal tab character (quoted as '	') which is
POSIX-compliant and works in all sh implementations.

This ensures git-branch-status works correctly in POSIX sh environments, not just
bash systems.
