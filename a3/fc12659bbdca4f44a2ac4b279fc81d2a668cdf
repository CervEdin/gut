Fixed POSIX shell compatibility in git-branch-status.

Problem: Used ANSI-C quoting syntax $'\t' to specify a tab character. This syntax
is bash-specific and not POSIX-compliant, causing the script to fail in POSIX
shells like dash (used on some systems).

Solution: Replaced $'\t' with a literal tab character (quoted as '	') which is
POSIX-compliant and works in all sh implementations.

This ensures git-branch-status works correctly in POSIX sh environments, not just
bash systems.

Whitespace formatting improvements and added git-stash-inspector.sh:

1. git-branch-status.sh: Reformatted for readability
   - Split long git for-each-ref command across multiple lines
   - Added tab indentation for continuation lines
   - Improves code readability and maintainability

2. git-stash-inspector.sh: New script to inspect stashes
   - Filters stashes related to a specific branch using --grep
   - Parses stash output to extract branch, commit hash, and title
   - Shows stash statistics and diffs for selected branch
   - Useful for managing WIP stashes across multiple branches

The stash inspector helps visualize what's in stashes before restoring them.
