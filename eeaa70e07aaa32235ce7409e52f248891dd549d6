Made git-branch-status.sh accept custom ref patterns as arguments.

Previously hardcoded to 'refs/heads', now accepts any ref pattern while
defaulting to 'refs/heads' when no args provided.

This enables useful workflows like:
- 'git branch-status refs/remotes/origin/**' - show remote branch status
- 'git branch-status refs/heads/feature/**' - show only feature branches
- 'git branch-status refs/tags/**' - show tag information
- 'git branch-status' - default behavior (local branches)

The "$@" passes all arguments to git for-each-ref, supporting multiple
patterns and full for-each-ref flexibility.
