Improved code readability by breaking long lines in git-fetch-ff script.

Problem: Long lines in git for-each-ref, sed, and awk scripts make diffs harder
to review and reduce code readability.

Changes: Reformatted to improve line-by-line readability:
- Split git for-each-ref format string across multiple lines with explicit quotes
- Expanded sed regex script across multiple lines with proper indentation
- Expanded awk BEGIN/END blocks with proper indentation and comments

This is a style-only change (no functional impact) that makes the complex pipeline
easier to understand and review. Each logical step is now clearly separated and
indented appropriately.
