Null-delimited xargs pattern (tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0):

This approach properly handles filenames with:
- Spaces
- Newlines
- Other special characters

xargs -d '\n' (GNU-specific) only handles newlines in filenames but fails on
other special characters. The null-delimited approach is:
- Fully portable (works on BSD and GNU)
- More robust (null bytes can't appear in filenames)
- Standard practice for handling arbitrary filenames in shell scripts
