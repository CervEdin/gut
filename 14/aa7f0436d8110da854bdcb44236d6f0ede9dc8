Added git-branch-status.sh: Show status similar to git branch -vv.

Displays branch status with tracking information, inspired by multiple Stack
Overflow solutions and the bill-auger/git-branch-status project, but optimized
for speed.

Shows three columns:
- Branch name
- Upstream tracking status ([ahead x], [behind y], [gone], etc.)
- Remote name

Uses git for-each-ref for efficient querying and column command for formatting.

A lot (all?) seems redundant.
