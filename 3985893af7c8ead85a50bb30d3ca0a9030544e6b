Work in progress commit that adds/modifies several scripts:

1. git-branch-status.sh: Split output into two sections - branches that contain
   origin/HEAD vs those that don't. Added ahead-behind tracking relative to
   origin/HEAD to show how far each branch has diverged.

2. git-describe-tree.sh: New script to describe a tree object by finding the
   latest commit that modified it. Useful for tracking when a specific directory
   state was last committed.

3. git-prune-merged.bash: Automatically deletes feature/maintenance branches on
   origin that are merged into origin/development and authored by current user.

4. git-week.sh: Filter branches by committer date range, showing work from a
   specific week. Excludes review/release/wip branches by default.
