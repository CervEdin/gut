Made git-arch support custom "decorations" instead of just "archive".

Enhanced git-arch to be a generic "decorated tag" utility supporting multiple
decoration types instead of being archive-specific:
- Added -d/--decor option to specify custom decoration (default: 'archive')
- Updated documentation to explain "decorated tags" concept
- Changed LISTMODE to listmode (lowercase convention)
- Updated variable STEM to use the decoration parameter

This enables use cases beyond archiving:
- 'archive' tags for persistent branch snapshots (existing use case)
- 'wip' tags for ephemeral checkpoints when saving work in progress
- 'milestone' or custom decorations for other workflow needs

Note: Author's TODO suggests renaming script to git-decor since it's no longer
archive-specific.
