Fixed SHA pattern regex in git-delorean.

Problem: The sed regex pattern /^[a-f,0-9]\{40\}/ incorrectly included comma (,)
in the character class, which is not part of valid SHA-1 hashes (only hexadecimal
a-f and 0-9).

Solution: Changed pattern from [a-f,0-9] to [a-f0-9] to match only valid SHA
characters.

This ensures the regex correctly identifies SHA lines from git blame output
without accidentally matching lines with commas.
