Added resolved file output to git-resolve for pipeline usage.

Enhancement: git-resolve now outputs the names of resolved files to stdout,
enabling further processing in pipelines.

Implementation uses tee with process substitution:
- Pipes file list to 'tee >(xargs git add)' when --add is set
- Outputs files to cat (unchanged) when --add is not set
- This allows output like: git resolve --ours | xargs sed '...'

This makes git-resolve more composable in shell pipelines for additional
processing on the resolved files.
