Renamed git-pp to git-push-interactive for clarity.

Problem: The short name "pp" was not descriptive and could be confused with other
tools or abbreviations.

Solution: Renamed git-pp.sh to git-push-interactive.sh with a simple rename (100%
similarity index), making the command's purpose immediately clear to users.

This follows the project's naming convention of using descriptive command names
rather than cryptic abbreviations.
