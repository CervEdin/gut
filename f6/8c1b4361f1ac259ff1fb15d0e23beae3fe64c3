Allow interactive picking of target in mebase.

Running 'git mebase -i' produces a numbered list of parent branches:
  1. a
  2. b
  3. c
  ...

Users can then press 1, 2, 3, etc. to select which parent to rebase onto.

Default behavior (without -i) selects the first parent according to git-parents.

This makes mebase more user-friendly by allowing explicit selection rather than
always rebasing onto the closest parent ref.
