Added git-fix-whitespace.sh to strip trailing whitespace from modified files.

The script:
- Uses git diff-index to find all modified files since the merge-base with origin/development
- Filters to files relative to current directory with --relative
- Pipes filenames to sed to remove trailing spaces with 's/ *$//'
- Only affects files that have uncommitted changes

This is useful for cleanup before committing to ensure consistent whitespace
across the codebase, following the convention that trailing spaces are undesired.

Note: This script has since been updated to use duck typing for BSD/GNU sed
compatibility in later commits.
