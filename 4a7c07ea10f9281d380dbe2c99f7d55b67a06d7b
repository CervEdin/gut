Added bash strict mode (set -euo pipefail) to all scripts.

This enables three safety features for all bash scripts:

- set -e: Exit immediately on any error (prevents cascading failures)
- set -u: Treat unset variables as errors (catches typos/logic bugs)
- set -o pipefail: Pipeline fails if any command fails (not just the last)

Applied to all four core scripts: git-arch, git-mebase, git-parents, git-resolve

Strict mode makes scripts more robust and predictable, preventing silent failures
that could lead to data loss or unexpected behavior.
