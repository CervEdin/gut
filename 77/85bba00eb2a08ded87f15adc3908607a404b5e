Improved pathspec handling in git-resolve.

Changes:
- Default pathspec to current directory '.' instead of requiring argument
- Fixed git ls-files call (old pathspec wasn't working correctly)
- Exit with error if unable to stat any files in the pathspec

TODOs noted:
- Consider using ':/' for repo-wide pathspec instead of '.'
- Evaluate if dying on stat failure is the right behavior

Makes git-resolve more usable as a default and more robust in edge cases.
