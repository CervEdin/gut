Added blank line after shebang for style consistency.

Added blank lines after shebangs in multiple scripts for improved code style:
- git-gone-local.sh
- git-prune-local.sh
- git-rebase-indent.sed

This follows Python and other language style conventions where a blank line
after the shebang improves readability and separates the script declaration
from the logic.
