Added explicit -a/--add flag to git-resolve (default: don't auto-add).

Previously git-resolve automatically staged resolved files, making it harder
to chain commands or manipulate files before staging.

Now:
- Default behavior: resolve conflicts but don't stage files
- With -a/--add flag: automatically stage resolved files after resolution

This gives users more control over the workflow and allows chaining with
other commands before deciding to stage.
