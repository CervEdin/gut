Added the initial set of git utility scripts.

This commit introduces four scripts:

1. git-arch: Creates and manages archive tags with naming convention
   <decoration>/<refname>/$(date) for persistent snapshots

2. git-mebase: Interactive rebase helper that finds the closest parent ref
   to rebase onto with automatic fixup/squash support

3. git-parents: Lists parent refs of current HEAD sorted by committerdate

4. git-resolve: Resolves merge conflicts in favor of ours/theirs/both
   while retaining non-conflict changes

NB: git-mebase is probably not useful anymore.
