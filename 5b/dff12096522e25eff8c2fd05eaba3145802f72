Added ASCII art cow to README ("What does the cow say?").

Added a classic ASCII cow ASCII art ASCII to the README with the speech bubble
"Gut is good!" to give the project a more friendly and approachable feel.

This is a lighthearted addition that humanizes the project and adds personality
to the documentation.
