Fixed git-fetch-ff to only operate on local tracking branches.

Problem: The script was operating on all refs, including remote tracking branches
(refs/remotes/). Fast-forward is not applicable to remote tracking branches since
they're read-only mirrors of the remote.

Solution: Added 'refs/heads/*' argument to git for-each-ref to restrict the query
to local branches only. This excludes remote tracking branches from processing.

This ensures the script only fast-forwards local branches that have configured
upstream tracking, which is the intended use case.
