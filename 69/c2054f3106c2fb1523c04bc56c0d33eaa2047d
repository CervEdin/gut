Match conflict markers only at the start of lines in git-resolve.

Improved conflict detection by anchoring the regex to the start of line (^).

Conflict markers always begin at column 0 and are exactly 7 characters long
(<<<<<<<, ======= or >>>>>>>). Matching only at line starts avoids false
positives where these patterns might appear elsewhere in file content.

This makes git-resolve more robust when resolving conflicts.

No! They are not always exactly 7 characters. This is the default, but may be
configured.

TODO: Read the actual markers from the local Git configuration.
